# LisGenerator

## What it is

LisGenerator is a Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) generator that takes one string input of any number of integers separated by single whitespace. It then outputs the longest increasing subsequence (increased by any number) present in that sequence. If more than 1 sequence exists with the longest length, output the earliest one. See example below.

Input
``` 
6 1 5 9 2
```
Output
```
1 5 9
```
